          We are a group of hockey enthusiasts and developers who built this
          platform to help the hockey community find reliable tournaments. We
          are not affiliated with any big hockey organizations; this is a
          public, passion-driven project.

          The Hockey Tournament Review Platform allows parents, players,
          coaches, and fans to review tournaments and share their experiences.
          Our goal is to provide transparency, improve event quality, and give
          everyone a voice in the hockey world.

          that meet their needs. With so many events available, our platform
          helps users make informed decisions through reviews, ratings, and
          shared experiences.

          aggregating community-driven feedback, tournament details, and nearby
          amenities, we bring transparency to the decision-making process.
